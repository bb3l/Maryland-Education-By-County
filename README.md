# **Maryland Education By County Project**
**Comparing educational outcome in Maryland counties**

**Background**

A couple and their children are moving to Maryland because the wife got a great job opportunity and are trying to find what county will be best to live in. Their number one concern is education. They have two kids, one will be starting as freshman in high school and the other will be a freshman in college. So, they want to make sure that they pick a county with a great educational system and outcome for their children.
They approach you with this task and ask if you can help.


**Objective**

Provide the couple with data that could best help them in their decision.


**Question that will help guide me:**
How do the counties compare in terms of graduation rates ?
Which county has the highest percent of highschool graduates ?



**Data**

Two sets of publicly available data were obtained through data.gov opendata.maryland.gov
-https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?organization_type=State+Government&organization=state-of-maryland
-https://opendata.maryland.gov/Demographic/Maryland-Counties-Socioeconomic-Characteristics/is7h-kp6x

I decided to clean the data and visualize the results using R and will be attaching the code. 

#Results

**What did I find out ?**

After comparing the graduations rates by counties, I realized that some counties have better rates than others. One thing that I was curious about was trying to find out if this could be affected by some kind of factor, like economica factor. 

**What factors play a role in the education system at the county level ?**

I then decided to get a second dataset to try and see what I can find. After cleaning it, I decided to explore the median household income per county. I found a trend! Students from counties with higher median household income have a better chance at graduating from highschool and college than those from lower median household income. This could be because of a lot of different reasons, like better school ressources and funding, better environment etc...
